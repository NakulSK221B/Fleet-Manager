## Introduction
The Fleet Manager application is designed to manage a fleet of robots for agricultural tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface to allocate tasks to robots, monitor their status, and view system logs.

## Features
- **Login Page:** Secure access to the system with user authentication.
- **Dashboard:** 
  - **Folium Map:** Displays markers representing the robots and predetermined destination locations (landmarks).
  - **Task Allocation:** Dropdown menus for selecting location, robot, and instructions.
  - **Job Card:** Displays the current job allocated to each robot along with the employee ID of the assignee.
  - **Battery Status:** Shows the battery levels of the electronics and motor batteries for each robot.
- **System Log Page:**
  - **Search Bar:** Filter logs by operator log, task log, battery logs, and movement log. Allows filtering by specific employee ID or robot ID.
- **Floating Sidebar:** Remains minimized unless hovered over. Once hovered upon, it presents options to navigate the pages (Dashboard and System Log Page) as well as the Logout button that redirects the user to the login page.
